Name: AllWISE Data
Description: AllWISE consists of images and a catalog that together provide a comprehensive view of the mid-infrared sky. The AllWISE Images Atlas includes 18,240 FITS images at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns, as well as depth-of-coverage and noise maps. The AllWISE Source Catalog is provided in Parquet format and contains accurate positions, apparent motion measurements, four-band fluxes, and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected on the Atlas Images.

  - Description: The AllWISE Images Atlas is comprised of 18,240 4-band (3.4, 4.6, 12, 22 microns) calibrated 1.56 deg x1.56 deg FITS images, depth-of-coverage and noise maps, and image metadata produced by coadding nearly 7.9 million Single-exposure images from all survey phases. The AllWISE Source Catalog contains accurate positions, apparent motion measurements, four-band fluxes and flux variability statistics for over 747 million objects detected on the deep, coadded Atlas Images. It is available in Apache Parquet, partitioned by HEALPix order 5. Additional presentations of this data may be added when available.
